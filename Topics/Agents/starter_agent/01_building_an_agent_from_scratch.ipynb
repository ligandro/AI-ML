    "### What is ReAct?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ReAct** (Reasoning + Acting) is a framework that combines reasoning and action in language models. It enables LLMs to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Think** - Reason about the problem and plan next steps\n",
    "- **Act** - Execute actions/tools to gather information\n",
    "- **Observe** - Process the results of those actions\n",
    "- **Answer** - Provide a final response based on reasoning and observations\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is that the LLM alternates between **thinking** (reasoning traces) and **acting** (interacting with external tools/APIs), rather than just generating a direct answer. This loop continues until the agent has enough information to provide a final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- Better problem-solving through step-by-step reasoning\n",
    "- Ability to use external tools and APIs\n",
    "- Transparent decision-making process\n",
    "- Reduced hallucinations by grounding responses in real data"

    "6. **Send the observation** back to the agent\n",
    "7. **Agent provides** the final Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Three Test Scenarios:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple Query** - \"How much does a pen cost?\"\n",
    "   - Single tool call (get_cost)\n",
    "   - Demonstrates basic ReAct flow\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multi-Step Query** - \"I want to buy a pen and a book. How much do they cost in total?\"\n",
    "   - Multiple tool calls (get_cost for pen, then for book)\n",
    "   - Shows how the agent chains actions together\n",
    "   - Requires calculation to sum the costs\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Wikipedia Query** - \"2024 United Kingdom elections\"\n",

    "   - Demonstrates integration with real-world data sources\n",

    "\n",
    "Instead of manually executing each step, we now automate the entire ReAct cycle. The agent can now run autonomously until it reaches a final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Regex Pattern for Action Detection**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "action_re = re.compile(r'^Action: (\\w+): (.*)$')\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Matches lines like: `Action: wikipedia: LangChain`\n",
    "- Captures the action name (`wikipedia`) and input (`LangChain`)\n",
    "- Used to parse the agent's response and identify when a tool should be called\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. The `query()` Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "Automates the ReAct loop with these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`max_turns=5`** - Limits iterations to prevent infinite loops\n",
    "- **`bot = Agent(prompt)`** - Creates a fresh agent with ReAct instructions\n",
    "- **`while i < max_turns:`** - Runs the loop up to 5 times\n",
    "- **`result = bot(next_prompt)`** - Gets agent's response (Thought + Action)\n",
    "- **Regex Parsing** - Scans the response for \"Action:\" lines using list comprehension\n",
    "- **Action Extraction** - Pulls out action name and input from the match\n",
    "- **Validation** - Checks if the action exists in `known_actions`\n",
    "- **Tool Execution** - Calls the corresponding function with the input\n",
    "- **Observation** - Formats the tool's result and sends it back to the agent\n",
    "- **Exit Condition** - If no actions are found, the agent has finished (returns final Answer)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Makes It Automated:**\n",
    "- No manual intervention needed\n",
    "- Automatically detects and executes tools\n",
    "- Loops until answer is found or max_turns reached\n",
    "- Handles multi-step reasoning seamlessly\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Examples:**\n",
    "1. **Complex calculation** - \"I want to buy 2 books and 3 pens\" (requires multiple get_cost calls + calculation)\n",
    "2. **Knowledge retrieval** - \"UEFA EURO 2024\" (requires Wikipedia lookup)"
